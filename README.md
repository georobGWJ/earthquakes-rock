Building seismic hazard assessment analysis code using Python (for fun)

Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis code has been implemented in many languages... Fortran, C++, Java, probably Matlab and others. I don't know what attempts have been made using Python. This repo aims to deveop this capability using Python.

Why? Because I want to learn the methodology and experiment with data structures.

If you want working, useful PSHA code, I recommend:
https://github.com/abrahamson/HAZ 
or
https://github.com/usgs/nshmp-haz

This repo is my playground for exploring PSHA calculations.
